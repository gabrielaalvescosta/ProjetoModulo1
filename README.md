# FugaParaKepler-186F
## A simple quiz game
A very simple 16-bit game made with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This was a first "term paper" of @resilia-br bootcamp. In this project was used a prompt to catch the player's answer through a function.

## Some term paper rules:
- Use Vanilla JavaScript and DOM to catch the answers
- Use pure CSS and HTML only
- Use a "while" and "function" in this project
- Must have at least 3 characters
- Must have a game over page
- Each level must have a HTML file




Projeto final do módulo 1 da @resilia-br. O objetivo era criar um jogo de perguntas e respostas em JavaScript com, no mínimo, 3 personagens, sendo o uso do prompt obrigatório.
